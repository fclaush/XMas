# 🎄 MERRY X-MAS Visualization with Python

Bring the holiday spirit to your Python projects with this Christmas-themed visualization! This project reads coordinate data from a CSV file and plots a festive "MERRY X-MAS" message using Matplotlib.

---

## ✨ Features
- **Custom Letter Drawing**: Visualizes individual letters based on (X, Y) coordinate data.
- **Festive Design**: Includes colorful markers and holiday-themed aesthetics.
- **Dynamic Dataset Support**: Easily modify the `merry_xmas.csv` file to create custom messages or shapes.
- **Scalable Plot**: Adjusts the visualization dynamically to fit within the canvas.

---

## 🎁 How It Works
1. **Input Data**: A CSV file containing:
   - `Letter`: The character associated with the coordinates.
   - `X` and `Y`: Coordinates for plotting.
   - Rows with missing values indicate breaks (pen-up moments) for disconnected parts of the letter.

2. **Drawing Logic**:
   - Groups data by `Letter`.
   - Draws continuous segments of each letter while handling gaps (pen-up moments).
   - Plots the results with festive markers and a holiday-themed grid.
